* Description

  \\ This is basically the inception of a habit tracker. You enter
  accomplishments that you feel/felt good about achieving, and then you can
  view these in a weekly scope. You can slowly add to the frequency of a given
  accomplishment. And also keep notes handy about them.

  Users can log in and have their own week, as well as see other user's weeks.

  Users can log in and sign up using Google and/or Github.

* Installation

  \\ Fork this project, clone it down to a folder you'd like to have it in. Navigate to the folder in you terminal of choice and run `bundle install`.
  You should probably run a `rake db:migrate`.
  Then you can `rails start` on your localhost and use the web app.

* Contribute

  \\ Please feel free to contribute. Just open a pull request. If something is
  wrong or doesn't work, see if you can figure out why. If you can't, reach out to me or file an issue on Github. <3.
